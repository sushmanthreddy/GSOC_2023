# GSOC 2023
This repository represents work done in gsoc 2023 for INCF and openworm foundation , we are upgrading here an semantic segmentation model to instance segmentation model.
Right now we have two approches one is fine tuning segment anything model on cell tracking challenge dataset and extracting centroids of cells in  time frame.

And other new method DevoNet will be coming soon it is an   instance segmentation model trained on same data.
